Created to enhance my learning in JavaScript and the use of APIs, this project was inspired by a YouTube video (link here). 
I made aesthetic modifications and added new features such as displaying the Pokémon's weight, height, type, generation, and 
shiny version, as well as a button to randomize the Pokémon.
